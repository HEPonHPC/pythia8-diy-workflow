!     This is a LEP setup at 91.2 GeV. Expect a single core event rate of 1500 events per second
!     without any rivet analyes --- this is an upper limit as running more and more rivet
!     analyses in conjunction with pythia becomes more costly. With the two analyses below
!     I see about 800 events per second.
!     It is desirable to accumulate of the order of 1 million events per parameter point.
!     E.g. using 100 ranks, each doing 10k events.
!
!     All parameters are implicitly set to the current default of whatever
!     version of pythia8 is used.
!
!     Typical rivet analyses are ALEPH_2004_S5765862 and DELPHI_1996_S3430090

!     The settings in 1) are overwritten by pythia8-diy, left them in for reference.

! 1) Settings that will be used in a main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 100000          ! number of events to generate
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! suppress full listing of first events

# random seed
Random:setSeed = on
Random:seed = 125442

! 2) Beam parameter settings.
Beams:idA = 11                ! first beam,  e- = 11
Beams:idB = -11                ! second beam, e+ = -11
Beams:eCM = 91.2               ! CM energy of collision
